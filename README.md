This is my Masters Research project for 2023-24 at the University of Melbourne.

Two different pipelines have been created so far:

The first is the main pipeline, this is able to take sequencing data and produce metrics for common single cell gene inference tools.

The second is a similar pipeline, expect it is able to run multiple functions at once. 

A third pipeline testing out prior usage for EMpirical Bayes will be created soon
